As a customer, you want sometimes to have multiple company user accounts within and across different companies, so that can access multiple companies with the same customer account but having different roles and permissions.
This functionality is especially important for sales agents, who may look after several company accounts at once. This will allow them to log in to different companies using the same credentials. Business on Behalf feature satisfies these requirements.
