One of the best e-commerce techniques to drive your sales and reduce marketing spendings is a cross-selling and upselling technique. With the functionality it provides, you can easily define specific product relations to present customers with recommendations. For example, when your customers buy a phone, you can display headphones or a phone case as additional items to encourage customers to buy more. Additionally, you can display product associations that let your customers see recommendations of products they might also be interested in. To up-sell items, you can build a set of suggestions to offer upscale product versions or additional fixtures to maximize the cart value. 

To make all this possible in your online shop, you can use the **Product Relations** feature that lets you define a list of items to be displayed as a set of comparable or additional products. You can choose to either use Spryker's condition rule builder to manually define relations or import the information from an external source.

To summarize, the Product Relations feature brings a lot of benefits to shop owners, including:

* boosting sales 
* improving customer experience by offering different products
* providing customers with more choices
* promoting the right products
* drawing the customers' attention to the goods that customers may also want to see
