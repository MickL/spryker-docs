Product measurement units designate standards that are used to express product quantity. Units of measure vary depending on the product types and may be item quantity in some cases (e.g., devices) and weight (e.g., fruits) or size (e.g., clothes) in others. However, one measurement unit per product is often not enough in terms of customer experience and order processing efficiency. For example, when buying avocados, some customers would prefer buying 1 piece, the othersâ€”1 kilogram or 1 pound. 

The Spryker Measurement Units per Product feature enables the support of alternate units of measure. It allows your customers to buy in multiple measurement units, eliminating the possibility of human errors, as conversion between units of measure and price adjustments are made automatically in the system. This feature also makes your customer order processing faster and more efficient by saving you the trouble of making all the manual calculations.
