In every B2B field, competition plays a major role. It forces business owners to focus on the core audience and improve the pricing strategy. Seeing what your competitors do well can provide a valuable insight into the state of the market and show what works and what doesn't. Still, for competitive or security reasons, because of customer loyalty or exclusivity, some shop owners would prefer to hide certain product information (e.g. prices, availability of stock) from competitors or other entities that do not have a buying intention. For cases like this, we have the Customer Access feature.

The feature allows you to give your customers the ability to hide content from End Customers that are not logged-in to their shop. You can restrict access to Prices, Products, Product Availability, Cart, and Shopping Lists (see the screenshot below).
