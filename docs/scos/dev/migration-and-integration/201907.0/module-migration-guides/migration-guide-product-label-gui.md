## Upgrading from Version 1.* to Version 2.*
In version 2 we have added multi-currency support. First of all make sure you [migrated the Price module](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/202001.0/module-migration-guides/migration-guide-price.html). We have changed ZED tables to use `PriceProductFacade` instead of the database join to get price, because that requires additional business logic processing before deciding which price to display. If you changed `AbstractRelatedProductTable` or `RelatedProductTableQueryBuilder`, check core implementation and update accordingly.
