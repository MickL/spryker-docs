## General Information
This section is a complete stack for running Spryker in Docker containers.

Spryker provides a standardized and customizable way to bootstrap applications and prepare development and production environments using the [Docker SDK tool](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/docker-sdk/docker-sdk.html).

Below, you will find a step-by-step checklist that you will be able to follow through all the stages to start working with Spryker in Docker.
 
 ## Prerequisites
 
Before you start installing your Spryker in Docker, follow the installation prerequisites for your operating system:
* [Linux](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/docker-installation-prerequisites-linux.html)
* [MacOS](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/docker-installation-prerequisites-macos.html)
* [Windows](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/docker-installation-prerequisites-windows.html)

## Installation 
There are several ways to install Spryker in Docker. See [Modes Overview](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/installation-guides/modes-overview.html) to learn about them.
If you've already selected an installation mode, follow one of the guides below:
* [Installation Guide - Development Mode](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/installation-guides/installation-guide-development-mode.html)
* [Installation Guide - Demo Mode](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/installation-guides/installation-guide-demo-mode.html)
* [Integrating Docker into Existing Projects](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/installation-guides/integrating-docker-into-existing-projects.html)
* [Running Production](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/development-guide/back-end/running-production.html)

## Configuration

Once you have a running instance, the following documents will help you adjust the project to your requirements:
* [Services](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/configuration/services.html)
* [Deploy File Reference - 1.0](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/docker-sdk/deploy-file-reference-1.0.html)
* [Additional DevOPS Guidelines](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/installation/spryker-in-docker/configuration/additional-devops-guidelines.html)
