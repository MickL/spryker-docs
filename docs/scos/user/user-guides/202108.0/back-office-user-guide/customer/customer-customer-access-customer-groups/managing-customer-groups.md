This article describes how to manage customer groups.

## Prerequisites

To start working with customer groups, navigate to the **Customers** > **Customer Groups** section.


:::(Info)
Out-of-the-box, there are no connections between customer groups and any other Back Office feature, except for the Discounts. You can set up the discount conditions to be applied to a specific customer group. See  [Discount Conditions: Reference Information](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/discount-conditions-reference-information) for more information on what the discount conditions are.

4. Click **Next** to proceed to the *Customers* tab, or just click on it.

    You can select as many customers as needed.
5. Click **Save**.

## Editing a customer group

To edit a customer group:

2. Update the needed attributes:
    * To unassign a user from the group, scroll down to the *Assigned customers* table and clear the checkbox on the left of the user you want to unassign. 
    * To reassign all customers, click **De-select All**.
3.  Click **Save**.
