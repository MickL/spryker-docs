This article describes how to manage merchant relations.
To start working with merchant relations, go to **Marketplace** > **Merchant Relations**.
***
## Prerequisites
To be able to create a merchant relation, you need to have a fully set up company account in the **Company Account** section as the company data drives from there.

## Creating a merchant relation
To create a merchant relation:
1. On the *Overview of Merchant relation* page, click **Add Merchant relation** in the top right corner.
2. On the *Create Merchant Relation* page, select the merchant in the **Merchant** drop-down list.
3. In the *Company* drop-down list, select the company with which you build the merchant relation, and click **Confirm**.
4. Select the business unit owner based on the company you selected and assigned business unit(s) based on the business unit owner. 
5. Once done, click **Save**.

The merchant is created and can be used to create merchant specific prices (see [Creating abstract products and product bundles](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/creating-abstract-products-and-product-bundles) and [Creating a product variant](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/creating-a-product-variant) to know more). As well as they can be used to create merchant relationship thresholds (see [Managing merchant order thresholds](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/managing-merchant-order-thresholds) for more details).

## Sorting the merchant relation table
You can sort the table of merchant relations based on the company for which the merchant relation has been created.

To sort the *List of Merchant relations* table, select a specific company in the *Company* drop-down list that is above the table.

Once the company is selected, the table is sorted to display only the merchant relations that are created with this specific company assigned.

## Editing a merchant relation
To edit a merchant relation:
1. On the *Overview of Merchant relation* page in the _Actions_ column, click **Edit** for a specific merchant relation.
2. On the *Edit Merchant Relation* page, you can update only the **Business unit owner** and **Assigned business units** values.
3. Once done, click **Save**.

## Deleting a merchant relation
To delete a merchant relation, click **Delete** in the _Actions_ column for a specific merchant relation on the *Overview of Merchant Relation* page.
