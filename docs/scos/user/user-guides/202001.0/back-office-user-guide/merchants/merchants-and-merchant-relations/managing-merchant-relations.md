This article describes how you create and manage the Merchant Relations in the Back Office.
***
To start managing merchant relations, navigate to the **Merchants > Merchant Relations** section.
***
**Prerequisites**
To be able to create a merchant relation, you need to have a fully set up company account in the **Company Account** section as the company data drives from there.
***
## Creating a Merchant Relation
To create a merchant relation:
1. On the **Overview of Merchant relation** page, click **Add Merchant relation** in the top right corner.
2. On the **Create Merchant Relation** page, select the merchant in the **Merchant** drop-down list.
3. In the **Company** drop-down list, select the company with which you build the merchant relation, and click **Confirm**.
4. Select the business unit owner based on the company you selected and assigned business unit(s) based on the business unit owner. 
5. Once done, click **Save**.

The merchant is created and can be used to create merchant specific prices (see [Creating an Abstract Product](/docs/scos/user/user-guides/202001.0/back-office-user-guide/products/products/abstract-products/creating-an-abstract-product.html) and [Creating a Product Variant](/docs/scos/user/user-guides/202001.0/back-office-user-guide/products/products/concrete-products/creating-a-product-variant.html) to know more). As well as they can be used to create merchant relationship thresholds (see [Managing Merchant Relationships Thresholds](/docs/scos/user/user-guides/202001.0/back-office-user-guide/thresholds/merchant-relationships/managing-merchant-relationships-thresholds.html) for more details).
***
## Sorting the Merchant Relation Table
You can sort the table of merchant relations based on the company for which the merchant relation has been created.

To sort the **List of Merchant relations** table, select a specific company in the **Company** drop-down list that is above the table.

Once the company is selected, the table is sorted to display only the merchant relations that are created with this specific company assigned.
