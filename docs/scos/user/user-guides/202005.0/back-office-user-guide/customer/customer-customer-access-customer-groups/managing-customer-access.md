The Customer Access page was designed to define what information can be viewed for the not-logged-into online store customers.

To start defining specific restrictions for not logged in customers, go to **Customers** > **Customer Access**.
***
To define the restrictions:
1. In the **Customer Access** section, select one of the following content types under the **Hide the following information from not logged in users**:
    * **price** - if selected, no prices will be shown to not logged in customers
    * **add-to-cart** - if selected, there will be no **Add to Cart** option displayed
    * **wishlist** - if selected, no **Wishlist** option is available
    * **Shopping List** - if selected, no **Add to Shopping List** option is available
    * **Can place an order** - if selected, the not logged in user is not able to place in order.
    {% info_block errorBox "**B2B Only**" %}
This option is selected by default and cannot be deselected.
{% endinfo_block %}
2. Click **Save** to save the changes.
